# Password-Generator

## Description of the Application

The Random password generator application is the application that generates a random password to the user when a user clicks the generate button after taking users inputs. So, the user will be prompt with a series of criteria including the length of the password, the character type to be included in the password. The length of the password character is range between 8-128. So, the prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number.
The application then prompts the user to define if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase character types. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts.
